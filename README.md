# image_processing_assignment2

this project was done in pycharm
python version 3.10.0

there are 2 files of code:

    ex2_utils.py , this file has all the functions
    ex2_main.py , this file has the last function

In this assignment we had to write 8 functions:

  conv1D - convolution for a 1D array
  conv2D - convolution for a 2D array
  convDerivative - Derivative of a image returning the magnitude and direction
  blurImage1 - blurring an image witha a guassain kernel my implementation
  blurImage2 - blurring an image witha a guassain kernel cv implementation
  edgeDetectionZeroCrossingLOG - edge detection
  houghCircle - finding circles in a image using hough transform
  bilateral_filter_implement - implementing this
  
  ## pictures of the bottem 7 functions
